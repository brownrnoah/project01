        <h2>Woes of a leaf</h2>
        <p>I walk a few blocks to work each day, and lately there have been quite a few leaves on the sidewalks.</p>
        <p><em>Gently Falling Leaf.<br>Here it lies, eternal sleep.<br>Victim to my feet.</em></p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>One of my biggest interests is Video games, and has been for some time. Recently though I have had a lot of fun playing
            Call of Duty Modern Warfare with some of my close friends and actually a few co-workers. I feel that they best way to enjoy
            video games is with friends.
        </p>
        <p>Another interest of mine is that of Anime and Manga. I just love the different ways they use to tell stories compared to some
            western cultures. They do a great job with their world buiding and how immersive those worlds can be. One of my favorite books
            that I listed is actually a manga called Spice and Wolf.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly a huge interest of mine is pets and animals. I love dogs, but unfortunately my current living situation doesn't allow
            me to own a dog. I currently own two ball pythons which I got only a few months ago. They have already grown quite a bit, and
            recently just went through their first sheds.
